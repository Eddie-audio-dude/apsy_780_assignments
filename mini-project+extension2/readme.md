Here is my submission for assignment 2. I created a human memory model that stores a random string of letters, of different lengths, in memory. I then have it set to retreive these strings to check if the items that were stored in memory were retrieved. If the retrieval matched the stored items, it was be coded as an accurate match. With this, I then used the group assignment/simulation script wrote in class to simulate multiple trials. Lastly, this data was then saved to a dated CSV file, and a file that can be used for plot creation within the module's runner. The plot is also set to save with the system date for later simulation documentation.
